            Trials of Loch
        </h2>
        <p id="Description">
            The Trials of Loch was developed in the MonoGame framework during my Problem Solving with Data Structures
            and
            Algorithms for Games course at RIT. I designed and implemented the projectile system, including trajectory
            calculations, firing logic, collision detection, and enemy-specific projectile behaviors. The careful
            implementation of math in this work provided consistent projectile motion and predictable gameplay
            interactions.
            Beyond gameplay mechanics, I developed the project's main menu and pause system, tying UI navigation into
            the
            game's internal state machine and ensuring smooth transitions between the different states of gameplay and
            UI.
            The project deepened my understanding of MonoGame's architecture and further developed my ability to
            implement
            algorithm-driven gameplay features.
