        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            For this project I chose to use the Art Institute of Chicago's API, to create an art
            finder.<br>
            The page works by taking in a request from the user using the search bar.<br>
            Taking that term and using the API's search URL, it looks for any art that is related to the term.<br>
            Each item that is returned has an API_Link URL, because the Art Institute uses another API to hold
            their images.<br>
            From there each artwork has an image id that when sandwiched between two URLs gives you the
            image back.<br>
            The images are then displayed to the users using the Materialize carousel framework, to create
            a revolving gallery effect.
        </p>
        <p class="Description">
            The special effort I put into this project is, first, making it look pleasing with the frame that appears
            when a
            search is done and the fact that it disappears when the image is clicked.<br>
            Another part was the feature I created where, when the image is clicked, it becomes larger so users can view
            the art
            better.<br>
            A description box about the piece is also displayed, and I created a way to close it so that users can look
            at the
            art piece without it obstructing the work.<br>
            I also created a dropdown filter where a user can filter results based on whether the art is public domain,
            modern,
            a painting, or a sculpture.<br>
            My final piece of special effort went into the favorites category. When a user likes a piece, they can add
            it to
            their favorites. This then adds the art image to the favorites area, where a smaller rounded image of the
            artwork is
            displayed with the title underneath.<br>
            The favorites section also has a dropdown menu where users can select from their favorites and remove a
            specific
            artwork if they no longer want it.<br>
            Both the images and dropdown menu are saved in local storage so users can always come back to the page to
            look at
            them.
